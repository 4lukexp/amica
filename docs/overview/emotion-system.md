Here are some other cool small features Amica comes with:

## How it Works

- tags
- system prompt

## Full Expression List

Users can load and save chat conversations as `.txt` files. This feature is ideal for storing conversation histories, reviewing past discussions, or continuing from where a previous session left off.

## Making Your Own VRM for Amica

Amica includes a wake word detection feature, allowing users to activate the assistant with a specific phrase. This enables hands-free operation and provides a more natural interaction with the system.

## Future Plans

In Chat Mode, Amicaâ€™s avatar minimizes into a corner of the screen, providing a compact interface. This feature is useful for multitasking, allowing users to interact with Amica while focusing on other tasks.

## Plugin System (Function Calling) Feature

Amica Life supports a customizable plugin system that allows users to add their own function calls. By placing scripts in the designated plugin folder, new functionalities can be seamlessly integrated, expanding Amica's capabilities.
